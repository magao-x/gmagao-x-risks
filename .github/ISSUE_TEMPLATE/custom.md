**Risk creation date:**  
<!-- Enter date after the **. Follow this same approach for subsequent entries in this form. -->
**Last Modified:** 

**Risk type:**    
<!-- Risk types include:  Technical, Cost, Schedule, Safety -->

# **Risk Statement:**

<!-- Write a risk statement in an If...then... format.  Start on the line after the risk statement header. -->

# **Risk Effects:**

<!-- Provide a longer description of the impact of realizing this risk. -->

# **Risk Assessment:**

| Risk Ratings | Likelihood     | Consequence     |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------- | 
| Initial      |   |   |
| Current      |   |   |
| Target       |   |   |
<!-- Provide initial, current, and target risk rankings in the gaps between the brackets.  Levels include:  0-Nil,1-Very low, 2-Low, 3-Moderate, 4-High, 5-Very High, and Risk Realized -->
<!-- Risk likelihood ratings are assigned as follows: -->
<!-- Likelihood |  Safety     |  Technical  |  Cost/Schedule  | -->
<!-- Very Low   | Ps < 1E-6   | 0.1 - 2%    |  Pcs < 10%      | -->
<!-- Low        |10^-6 - 10^-3|  2 - 15%    |  10 - 25%       | -->
<!-- Moderate   |10^-3 - 10^-2| 15 - 25%    |  25 - 50%       | -->
<!-- High       | 0.01 - 0.1  | 25 - 50%    |  50 - 75%       | -->
<!-- Very High  | Ps > 0.1    | Pt> 50%     | Pcs > 75%       | -->

<!-- Risk consequences rating should be based on the following guidelines: -->
<!-- Consequence | Safety            | Technical              | Cost                           | Schedule                  | -->
<!-- ....................................................................................................................... -->
<!-- Very Low    | negligible impact | negligible impact      | Cost overrun <1% of allocation | Neglible schedule slip    | -->
<!-- ....................................................................................................................... -->
<!-- Low         | Minor injury, no  | All reqs met, decrease | Cost overrun 1-3% of allocation| Schedule slip to affected | -->
<!--             | lost work time    | in capabilities/margin |                                | item; no slip to critical path | -->
<!-- ....................................................................................................................... -->
<!-- Moderate    | Injury with lost  | Major loss of instrument | Cost overrun 3-10% of        | Schedule slip affecting   | -->
<!--             | work time         | capability               | allocation                   | critical path, not launch | -->
<!-- ....................................................................................................................... -->
<!-- High        | Severe injury     | Loss of 1 or more Level-1| Cost overrun 10-20% of       | Critical path schedule    | -->
<!--             |                   | science requirements     | allocation                   | slip of 1-3 months        | -->
<!-- ....................................................................................................................... -->
<!-- Very High   | Death or permanently| Loss of instrument, S/C, | Cost overrun >20% of       | Critical path schedule    | -->
<!--             | disabling injury    | or payload               | allocation                 | slip of >3 months         | -->
<!--  ...................................................................................................................... -->

**Initial Risk Notes:**

<!-- Capture initial notes on the risk and its current state at the time of risk creation. -->

**Risk Notes/Updates:**

<!-- Put notes here as updates are made.  Preface each note with the date. -->

# **Cost Impacts:**
**Estimated cost if risk is realized:**

**Explanation for cost risk:**

# **Risk mitigation list:**
<!-- Create as many mitigations as needed by typing in the mitigations after the [ ].  Once the risk is created, we can generate separate issues for each of these mitigations.  This risk form will serve as the place for tracking the completion of mitigations. If a mitigation issue is closed, a green checkmark should appear next to that item.  You can also mark an issue as closed by putting an X between the two brackets. -->
